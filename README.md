# Rendering roadmap
#### Tutorial project for going through the rendering roadmap.

1. Initialize D3D12 context
2. Load simple model without animation
3. Process input and camera control
4. Load mip-mapped textures (diffuse, normal, specular, gloss)
5. Load skinned mesh (GPU) animated model
6. Animation blending between states and merging (shooting while running for example)
7. Calculate Phong lighting from direct and point lights in the pixel shader
8. GPU compressed textures
9. Particle System (10000+ particles)
10. Make soft shadows (SM+PCF, VSM or ESM)
11. Make dynamic environment reflections via render to cube map
12. Add fog effect (pixel shader or post-process)
13. Add bloom post-process effect
14. Deferred lighting approach (direct, capsule, point and spot lights)
15. Cook-Torrance BRDF model and Image Based Lighting (static)
16. HDR pipeline (auto exposure, tone mapping)
17. MSAA
18. SSAO
19. SSLR
